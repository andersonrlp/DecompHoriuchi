#' @title implementation of the decomposition algorithm of stepwise replacement  
#' @description This implements the algorithm described in Andreev et al (2002), with defaults set
#' to approximate their recommendations for replacement ordering and result averaging.
#' @details The \code{symmetrical} argument toggles whether or not we replace rates1 with rates2 (\code{FALSE}), 
#' or take the arithmetic average or replacement in both directions. \code{direction} refers to whether we go 
#' from the bottom up or top down, or take the arithmetic average of these when replacing vector elelements. 
#' Although the total difference will always sum correctly, the calculated contribution from individual components 
#' can vary greatly depending on the order in general. Defaults are set to symmetrically replace from the bottom 
#' up, per the authors' suggestion.
#' 
#' @param func A function specified by the user. This must be able to take the vectors \code{rates1} or 
#' \code{rates2} as its argument, and to return the value of the function, \code{y}, when evaluated for 
#' these rates. It may also have additional arguments, not to be decomposed.
#' @param rates1 vector of covariates to be passed on as arguments to \code{func()}. Covariates
#' can be in any order, as long as \code{func()} knows what to do with them. \code{rates1} is for time 1 
#' (or population 1).
#' @param rates2 is the same as \code{rates1} but for time/population 2.
#' @param symmetrical logical. default \code{TRUE} as recommended by authors. Shall we average the results of replacing 1 with 2 and 2 with 1?
#' @param direction. character. One of \code{"up"}, \code{"down"}, or \code{"both"}. Default \code{"up"}, as recommended by authors.
#' @param \dots optional parameters to pass on to \code{func()}.

#' @export
#' @return a matrix of the variable effects that is organized in the same way as 
#' \code{rates1} and \code{rates2}.

#' @title an abridged lifetable based on M(x)
#' @description Implements the abridged lifetable formulas given in the supplementary material to Andreev et al (2012). An entire lifetable is calculated, but only lfie expectancy at birth is returned.
#' @details Chiang's a(x) is assumed in the following way: \eqn{a(0) = 0.07 + 1.7 * M(0)}, \eqn{a(1) = 1.6}, \eqn{a(\omega) = \frac{1}{M(\omega)}}, and all others are assumed at mid interval. The last age is assumed open. Everything else is pretty standard.
#' @param Mx numeric vector of abridged mortality rates.
#' @param Age integer, abrdged age lower bounds. 
#' @param radix numeric. Can be anything positive.

#' Comparison decomposition results by age and cause
#'
#' A matrix containing the contributions to the difference in life expectancy at birth between 2002 US males and England and Wales males. Ages (in rows) are in abridged categories, 0-85, and there are six causes, including other, in columns. The sum of the matrix is the difference in life expectancy at birth between the two populations. Values are based on symmetrical stepwise replacement from young to old ages only. This is just to make sure implementation is close.
