Description: This package contains two functions for continuous decomposition.
    One, a direct R translation of the Matlab code offered by Horiuchi et al
    (2008) (DecompContinuousOrig()), and another a slightly friendlier but less
    flexible implementation (DecompContinuous). We also have an implementation 
    of Andreev et al's 2002 stepwise replacement decomposition.
